				<p>Welcome to my first online portfolio! My name is Faye (Yueh) and I love creating things.</p>

        <p>When I was young, my first dream job was to become an inventor, but all I had in the house was paper and tape lying around. As I was growing up, my dream professions changed from artist to musician, musician to author...</p>
        
        <p>When I was in late elementary, I made several incomplete <i>games</i>. My old time favorite was a <i>Mario Party</i> clone made of paper, cardboard pieces, sharpies, and a lot of tape. Eventually, I resorted to using PowerPoint slideshows with button events as basic games.</p>
        
        <p>But I could only do so much, so I asked my tech-savvy father if he could teach me <i>programming</i>. It was a foreign word at the time, but I knew that it's what made games happen. He asked me why, and I explained that I couldn't allow text inputs in my PowerPoint games, as well as make numerous combinations of choices. When I was in middle school, my dad gave me a few lessons in Visual Basic (either 6 or .NET), and bought me my very own programming book.</p>

        <p>Over the next few years, on top of my newfound programming knowledge, I continued to do hobbyist art, and <i>incomplete</i> storywriting and music-composition. I was never good at anything in particular, and it often discouraged me about my future. In high school, while my peers talked about their future career choices, I could only listen; I didn't even want to go to college because I didn't know what I want to do in life.</p>
        
        <p>It was soon after that I've found game developing to be a legitimate job.</p>

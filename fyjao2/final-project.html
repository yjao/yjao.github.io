  			  <p>There are many different types of users and it's impossible to know what everybody wants. User interviews allow developers to gather qualitative data they wouldn't be able to collect elsewhere. During interviews, it's helpful to ask users what features they expect or would add themselves, and any concerns they might have.</p>

  			  <p>A competitor is someone who is trying to build a similar application as you are, and a competitor analysis is to analyze the features, strengths and weaknesses, and other details about the product. I picked two of my coworkers and a game developer found online; I reviewed them because their portfolios are game developer-focused, and that's what I was going for.

  			  <h1>Feature Value Matrix</h1>

  			  <p>A developer may list and rank features in regards to how important it is for users and stakeholders, and how much effort is required on the development side. This is a feature value matrix and it is a prerequisite for feature prioritization. Aside from the obvious contact info and abouts page, I listed features such as links to external websites, and personality. I believe both of them are helpful to an employer in getting to know the applicant.</p>

  			  <p>I placed the about page and email address as top priority because those two are what the employers look at often. A resume link comes second because some employers would only check portfolios after having seen a resume. Other features such as projects page, web form contact, personal photo, and external websites are also important, but some take more time to implement than another. Lastly, personality is hard to design in general, so it should be low priority. Prioritization isn't just about how beneficial it would be to have a feature, but also the time and effort it will take to complete it, something to be thinking about when building an interface.</p>

  			  <p>User stories comes naturally from a feature value matrix as the premise is to dig into the backstory of a persona wanting a feature. It is important because we don't always know the context of why we needed a feature, and having a persona gives it a purpose. I looked into my features list and thought over who would appreciate it, and went from there.</p>

  			  <p>Conducting cognitive walkthroughs are important because developers would not be able to predict the (re)actions of the users. By watching users closely, we could see any mistakes they made or signs of confusion, all possibly due to bad design choices. When I was conducting my own walkthroughs, I personally found it hard to take in criticism.</p>

  			  <p>I have chosen 2 tests. One is a Click test for my project page's download link. The other is to have the tester study the main page (now About Me) for 5 seconds, then answer a few questions; testers are asked if they knew what the site owner's name was, and if they know how to contact her. For privacy reasons, I changed the the site owner's name and contents for the testing screenshots. One challenge I faced was to determine whether or not it was my switched out screenshots that caused the confusion for testers. More on my findings will be discussed below.</p>

			  <p>[Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of your findings.  Be sure to include insights from conducting your research and tests as well as any challenges faced.  If you are not quite sure of what conclusions can be drawn, pose a hypothesis as to possible solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved.]</p>
